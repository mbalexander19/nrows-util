NROWS Orders Analysis Tool

v0.1, January 2024

POC: Github mbalexander19 (contact for official email)

Written in Python v3.12.1 with pandas v2.2.0. There is no guarantee of compatibility for prior or future versions.

This is a utility for parsing and analyzing U.S. Navy Reserve orders data (AT/ADT/IDTT) for inclusion in monthly ops reports. You will need your own data from NROWS (HTML - just save the output of your query) to use this. The primary audience is unit N3s who want to save a bit of time while increasing accuracy on their reporting.

Mob/ADOS orders could be analyzed as well but would require manual data input.

Planned future features:
1. Integration of report parsing and analysis (i.e., get straight from NROWS data to output with one command)
2. Add chart outputs, such as AT completion during a given time period
3. Input a planning functionality

Contributions or feature requests from other users are welcome, but remember that I am doing this part time and (mostly) without pay. If you do use this, please send me a message with your name and unit - both to add you to the COI and for my own FITREP metrics :).
